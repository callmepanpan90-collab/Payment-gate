# Payment Gate Project

This is a static HTML project using Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenishasung43020-web/Payment-Gate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Payment-Gate
   ```
   *(Note: If you downloaded the project folder as `NewHtml`, navigate into that instead)*

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To watch for changes in your CSS files and rebuild automatically during development:

```bash
npm run build-css
```

This command runs `tailwindcss` in watch mode.

## Building for Production

To build the minified CSS for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Running the Website

Since this is a static HTML project, you can:

1. Open `index.html` directly in your web browser.
2. OR use a local development server (like "Live Server" in VS Code) for a better experience.
