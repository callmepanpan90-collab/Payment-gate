# Payment Gate Project

This is a static HTML project using Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/callmepanpan90-collab/Payment-gate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Payment-Gate
   ```
   *(Note: If you downloaded the project folder as `NewHtml`, navigate into that instead)*

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```



## Running the Website

Since this is a static HTML project, you can:

1. Open `index.html` directly in your web browser.
2. OR use a local development server (like "Live Server" in VS Code) for a better experience.
